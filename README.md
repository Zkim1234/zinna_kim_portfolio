## About My Portfolio

This portfolio showcases projects where strategy meets execution — from multi-step booking systems built without plugins to interaction-driven web experiences. Each project highlights my approach to UX thinking, structured problem-solving, and translating Figma designs into fully working products.

I focus on clarity, usability, and mobile-first design while maintaining strong attention to detail in both visuals and code.

## About Me

I enjoy working at the intersection of design and development. I’m constantly refining how users move through digital experiences — simplifying complexity, improving flow, and building interfaces that feel intuitive and purposeful.

Currently growing as a UX designer and front-end developer, always learning, building, and iterating.
